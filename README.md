(Piepline, KNN, XGBoost)Selected and tuned a predictive model for a renewable energy resource company looking to reduce cost for repairing generators on their wind turbines. The data had missing values that were imputed using KNN. The model was selected on minimizing the total service cost of predicting generator failure. The costs associated are as follows: replacement, repair, and inspection. The model selection also included seeing how certain models did with over sampled and under sampled data.  The top models were tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to save time compared to GridSearchCV. A pipeline was built for the final selected model to help automate the predictions for further use.
