# ReneWind
(Pipeline, KNN, XGBoost)Selected and tuned a predictive model for a renewable energy resource company looking to reduce cost for repairing generators on their wind turbines. 
The data had missing values that were imputed using KNN. The model was selected to minimize the total service cost of predicting generator failure, and the associated expenses are as follows: replacement, repair, and inspection. The model selection also included seeing how specific models did with oversampled and undersampled data. The top models were tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to save time compared to GridSearchCV. Conclusively, a pipeline was built for the final selected model to help automate the predictions for further use.
